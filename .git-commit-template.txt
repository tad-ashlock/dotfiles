# Type(<scope>): <subject>
# <body>
# <footer>

# Type should be one of the following:
# * feature (new feature)
# * fix (bug fix)
# * doc (changes to documentation)
# * style (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)
# * refactor (refactoring production code)
# * test (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
# * chore (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
# * workaround (change due to problems outside our control)
# Scope is just the scope of the change.  Something like (admin) or (teacher).
# Subject should use impertivite tone, future tense and say what the change
# will do.  The body should go into detail about changes made.
# The footer should contain any Gitlab issues to close, like this:
# * Closes #<issue_id>
# * Closes #<issue_id>, #<issue_id>
